# Guide Enhancement Research Prompt

Use this prompt to brainstorm additional useful information for XDA accessories guides without changing the core "mass listings with features" format.

---

## Prompt

```
I maintain accessory guides on XDA Forums for smartphones. Each guide is a series of forum posts containing:

- **Tables of accessories** (cases, screen protectors, chargers, mounts, skins)
- **Key features per item** (MagSafe compatible? Kickstand? S Pen access? Price?)
- **Purchase links**
- **Device-specific warnings** (e.g., "no internal magnets", "film only for foldables")

The format is intentionally simple: mass listings with feature columns, not detailed reviews.

**What additional information would XDA power users find valuable that fits this format?**

Consider:
1. **New table columns** - What features am I missing that matter for accessory selection?
2. **New accessory categories** - What accessory types should I add sections for?
3. **Quick reference data** - What device specs should I highlight more prominently?
4. **Warnings/compatibility notes** - What common mistakes should I help users avoid?
5. **Community features** - What would encourage users to contribute or update info?

Keep suggestions compatible with:
- BBCode forum formatting (tables, lists, bold/italic)
- Quick scanning (no wall of text)
- Easy maintenance (I update these periodically)

Examples of current guides:
- Cases tables with: Brand | Model | MagSafe | Kickstand | Port Cover | Links
- Screen protector tables with: Brand | Product | Type (Glass/Film) | Install Method | Links
- Charger tables with: Brand | Model | Output | Protocol | Links
```

## Ideas to Evaluate

After getting LLM suggestions, evaluate each against these criteria:

| Criteria | Question |
|----------|----------|
| **Useful** | Does this help users make better purchase decisions? |
| **Scannable** | Can users find this info in 2-3 seconds? |
| **Maintainable** | Can I keep this accurate with reasonable effort? |
| **Universal** | Does this apply to most phones, not just one? |

## Potential Areas (Starter List)

- **Weight** column for cases (rugged users care about this)
- **Drop rating** (MIL-STD-810G, etc.)
- **Warranty info** for expensive accessories
- **Regional availability** (US/EU/Asia)
- **"Works with case" column** for screen protectors
- **USB-C cable quality notes** (for fast charging)
- **Affiliate-free links** disclaimer
- **User-submitted additions** section format
