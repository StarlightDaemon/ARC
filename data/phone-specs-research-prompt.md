## Prompt Template

```
I'm creating an accessories guide for the [PHONE NAME] on XDA Forums. The guide covers:
- Cases (rugged, everyday, slim)
- Screen protectors
- Chargers (wired and wireless)
- Mounts
- Skins/wraps

What are the KEY SPECS and FEATURES of this phone that affect accessory compatibility? I need to know:

1. **Charging specs**
   - Max wired charging wattage and protocol (USB-PD, PPS, proprietary?)
   - Max wireless charging wattage and protocol (Qi, Qi2, MagSafe, proprietary?)
   - Any proprietary fast charging (SUPERVOOC, TurboPower, etc.)?

2. **Physical features affecting cases**
   - Does it have an alert slider, action button, or similar?
   - Camera island shape and size?
   - Any special sensors or features on the back?
   - Is it a foldable? If so, hinge type and inner/outer screen sizes?

3. **Display/screen protector considerations**
   - Flat or curved display?
   - Under-display fingerprint sensor type (optical, ultrasonic)?
   - Any special display tech that affects screen protector compatibility?
   - If foldable: inner screen film requirements

4. **Magnetic/mount compatibility**
   - Built-in MagSafe/Qi2 magnets?
   - Compatible with what mount systems (Quad Lock, Peak Design, etc.)?
   - Any official magnetic accessories?

5. **Special accessories**
   - S Pen or stylus support?
   - Official accessories worth mentioning?
   - LED/Glyph patterns (Nothing phones)?

Please provide factual specs with sources where possible.
